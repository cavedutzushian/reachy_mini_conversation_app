# Validation Guide: Optional Gemini Conversation Backend

This guide applies after implementation. Planning does not add Gemini support, dependencies,
RPC methods, or environment options. Follow the root README for environment/robot setup.

## Prerequisites

- Agreed issue and maintainer approach review; accepted usage/data budget.
- Supported environment and Reachy with working microphone, speaker, and camera.
- Eligible personal Gemini Developer API account, Live model access, and quota.
- Private credentials in the existing process/instance environment configuration.
- Implementation dependencies installed and lock synchronized. Verify soxr wheels on actual
  Reachy hardware and supported desktops; availability is not proven by this plan.
- Disposable memory facts; no secrets or sensitive facts in validation material.

## Configuration after implementation

Add privately to the existing instance .env per the root README; never commit a real key:

```dotenv
REACHY_MINI_CONVERSATION_BACKEND=gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-private-key>
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-3.8-live
GEMINI_VOICE=Kore
```

Saved UI selection overrides environment defaults. For untouched-default testing remove
the saved provider choice in a disposable instance; unsetting env does not override saved
selection. Keep BACKEND_PROVIDER and MODEL_NAME obsolete. See the
[selection contract](contracts/backend-selection.md) for precedence and readiness.

## Automated validation

From the repository root, with environment active, run separately and stop on first failure:

```text
ruff check . --fix
ruff format .
mypy --pretty --show-error-codes
pytest tests/ -v
uv lock --check
```

Do not hide unrelated failures with exclusions or weakened checks. Prior session checks
found Spec Kit script lint/format failures and pytest setup errors; their resolution is
not part of this planning claim. A green feature subset is not a green full gate.

After the new suites exist, targeted verification can use:

```text
pytest tests/test_gemini_realtime.py tests/test_console.py tests/test_settings_store.py tests/audio/test_resampling.py -v
```

Fake-wire coverage must prove setup acknowledgement, multipart content, both transcript
directions, PCM rate conversion, interruption boundaries, schema/name validation, silent
nonblocking responses, permissions/cancellation, duplicate IDs, rejected resume, old-generation
suppression, and redaction. HF regression tests must pass before and after shared extraction.

## Hardware trials

```text
reachy-mini-conversation-app --ui
```

1. Untouched instance defaults to HF with no Gemini key. Verify local/deployed modes and
   legacy startup personality/voice remain intact (SC-001).
2. Select Gemini, complete 15 minutes and at least ten exchanges with a chosen personality,
   and check greeting/transcripts. Explicit Retry may be needed at service connection limits;
   record resumed/fresh indicators, not a single-socket guarantee (SC-002, SC-007, SC-008).
3. Interrupt ten responses. Measure recognition-to-stop time: at least nine within one
   second, no abandoned speech played later in any trial (SC-003).
4. Request each essential action. Validate sleep separately because it ends the app;
   relaunch for remaining trials. Include an ordinary operational failure and subsequent
   successful spoken exchange. Inject exceptional failures in fake-wire tests (SC-004).
5. Perform ten switches including during speech/action execution. Confirm one active
   conversation, no duplicate motion, settings retained, and fresh live context (SC-005).
6. Request one observation of a distinct object. Confirm one snapshot and no continuous
   capture. Disable camera globally and via tool access separately; test unavailable camera
   and resumed conversation after failure (SC-009, SC-011).
7. Save a disposable fact with each provider, switch and recall, then forget and start fresh
   conversations on both providers. Verify fact deletion. Global memory off prevents
   injection/mutation but preserves stored facts. Disabling remember/forget alone does not
   disable saved-memory recall (SC-010, SC-011).
8. Force network loss and session closure. Confirm explicit Gemini Retry, correct resumed
   versus fresh status, and no replay of uncertain actions. Profile/voice/memory refresh
   must announce fresh context and prevent stale-handle resume (SC-007).
9. Cover missing/rejected key, unsupported model/voice, unavailable access, and quota errors.
   Use fake failures where real ones cannot be safely induced; do not manufacture quota
   exhaustion. Settings/Retry/manual HF remain usable and credentials stay private (SC-006).

## Evidence and limitations

Record OS, SDK/package version, model/voice, actual sample rates, timings, session transitions,
action outcomes, and sanitized failure reasons against SC-001 through SC-011. Mocks do not
establish hardware quality or account eligibility. Do not retain keys, handles, image payloads,
or personal transcripts in evidence. See [data model](data-model.md) and
[session contract](contracts/realtime-session.md) for precise ownership and continuity rules.
